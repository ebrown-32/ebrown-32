**About Me:**

- I studied computer science @ the University of Nebraska. Go Big Red!
- I don't really get bored, currently fascinated with all things AI, economics, golf, health tech, travel, space...
- Always down to talk sports, movies, tech, dogs, games, fantasy football, or national parks.
- Get in touch! Shoot me an email, DM, whatever works.
